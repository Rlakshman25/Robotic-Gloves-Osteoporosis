ðŸ¤– Smart Robotic Supportive Glove for Osteoporosis Patients
 
A multi-functional wearable glove that assists osteoporosis patients with finger movement, health monitoring, and haptic feedback. This glove uses sensors, servo motors, and a vibration system to provide an intelligent and assistive solution. IoT features can be added for remote monitoring.

ðŸ§  Project Overview

This glove has 3 smart operational modes:
1. Health Monitoring Mode â€“ Monitors SpO2, Heart Rate, and Blood Pressure. Triggers vibration if pulse drops.
2. Active Finger Therapy Mode â€“ Moves each finger (servo-controlled) individually for physical therapy.
3. Full-Hand Movement Mode â€“ All fingers move simultaneously in a looped pattern to support grip recovery.

Each mode runs for a specific duration and loops intelligently.

ðŸ§© Features

âœ… Pulse oximeter-based health tracking  
âœ… Servo-controlled individual finger movements  
âœ… Vibration motor for feedback and alerts  
âœ… OLED display for live data  
âœ… DHT11 + BMP180 for temp/humidity/pressure  
âœ… Modular and upgradable with IoT features
